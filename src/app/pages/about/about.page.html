  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h3>Our Origin Story</h3>
  <p>
    Vault 42 was part of an ambitious experiment designed to preserve humanity's
    botanical heritage. Much like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway,
    Vault 42 was entrusted with the sacred duty of storing seeds of almost every
    known plant species. However, unlike Svalbard, Vault 42 had a unique twist
    inhabitants were provided with light bulbs of no more than 40 watts,
    creating an environment shrouded in perpetual twilight.
