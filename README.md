 # Vault 42



## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

 
1. **npm install** - Install the project dependencies.
2. **npm start** - Start the project.
 
 
 
 This project Contains GraphQL queries for retrieving product and category data.
 These queries are used with Apollo Angular to generate fully-typed Apollo GraphQL services.
 To generate the types and services, run the command: npm run generate

 Not typing or manually maintaining the data-types can lead to many issues:
 - Outdated typing (regarding the current Schema)
 - Typos
 - Partial typing of data (not all Schemaâ€™s fields have a corresponding type)

For more information on generating types and services, refer to the following documentation:
- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/guides/angular)
- [Generated files collocation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/advanced/generated-files-colocation)
